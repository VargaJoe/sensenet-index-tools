# Fix for ContentComparer Duplication Issues

## Issue Description

The ContentComparer had two related issues:

1. **Duplicate Display Issue**: Items with the same path but different NodeIds were incorrectly grouped together, showing multiple identical entries in the comparison results when they should be distinct entries.

2. **Incorrect Matching**: When comparing database and index items, the code was sometimes matching items with the same ID but different versions, or mismatching items at the same path.

### Example Issue

Items with different IDs and versions at the same path were either:
- Incorrectly shown as duplicates (same items repeated)
- Or incorrectly matched (database item with ID 194348 matched with wrong index item)


## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Item Grouping in Create()**:
   - Updated the LINQ GroupBy statement to consider both NodeId and VersionId when grouping items
   - This ensures items with the same path but different IDs or versions are treated as separate entries

2. **Improved Matching Logic in CompareContent()**:
   - Enhanced path matching to also check for version matches
   - Added specific handling for items with the same ID but different versions
   - Updated logic for "index-only" items to avoid incorrect merging with database items

3. **Enhanced Reporting**:
   - Improved output messages to clarify when items are differentiated by ID and version
   - Added better logging to report version mismatches

## Test Case

The `TestDuplicatePaths` project was added to verify the fix. It:
- Scans a Lucene index for content items
- Identifies items with the same path but different IDs or versions
- Reports all found duplicates, showing that our fix correctly handles these cases

## Expected Outcome

After these changes:
1. Items with the same path but different IDs will be shown as separate entries
2. Database and index items will only be matched when both ID and version match
3. Cleanup operations like clean-orphaned will correctly identify and remove orphaned items
