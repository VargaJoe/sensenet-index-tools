# Future Enhancement Plan for SenseNet Index Maintenance Suite

This document outlines potential enhancements and new features for the SenseNet Index Maintenance Suite.

## Repository

This project is maintained at: https://github.com/VargaJoe/sensenet-index-tools

## Current Functionality

The suite currently supports:
- Retrieving the LastActivityId from a SenseNet Lucene index (`get` command)
- Setting a new LastActivityId in an existing index (`set` command)
- Initializing a LastActivityId in a non-SenseNet Lucene index (`init` command)
- Automatic backup creation before making changes
- Validating index structure and integrity (`validate` command)
- HTML report generation with interactive features and visualizations
- Checking database-index synchronization for subtrees (`check-subtree` command):
  - Enhanced detection capabilities with multiple search strategies
  - Accurate document validation and inspection
  - Content type distribution analysis
  - Version state tracking (published vs. draft content)
  - Detailed reporting with statistics in markdown and HTML formats

## Implementation Priority

Proposed implementation order based on value and complexity:

1. Index Validation & Repair (highest immediate value)
2. ActivityId Gap Management
3. Enhanced Backup & Recovery
4. Index Performance Optimization
5. Multi-Index Management
6. Integration Enhancements
7. Usability Improvements

## Technical Considerations

- Maintain compatibility with both SenseNet API and direct Lucene.NET access
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing command structure
- Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Provide detailed documentation for each new feature
- Implement automated tests for all new functionality

## Timeline Estimates

- **Phase 1 (Index Validation & ActivityId Gap Management)**: 2-3 months
- **Phase 2 (Backup/Recovery & Performance Optimization)**: 2-3 months
- **Phase 3 (Multi-Index & Integration Features)**: 3-4 months
- **Phase 4 (Usability Improvements)**: 1-2 months

Total estimated timeline: 8-12 months depending on resource allocation
