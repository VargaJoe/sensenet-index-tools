# ContentComparer Enhancements & Fixes

## Duplicate Entry Fix

The enhanced ContentComparer now properly handles multiple versions of content items at the same path. A bug was fixed where items with the same path but different IDs would sometimes appear as duplicates in the report.

### Problem Identified
When comparing items, the previous implementation used a simple grouping key based on:
- Normalized Path
- Content Type
- ID (which could be either database NodeId or index NodeId)

This caused issues in specific cases where:
1. An item existed in both the database and index
2. Items with the same path but different IDs could appear duplicated

### Solution
The grouping logic was updated to create a more sophisticated unique identifier:
- For items in both database and index: `both_{NodeId}_{IndexNodeId}`
- For database-only items: `db_{NodeId}`
- For index-only items: `idx_{IndexNodeId}`

This ensures that each unique combination of path, type, and ID appears exactly once in the results.

### Additional Improvements
- Added a check to prevent matching database items that have already been matched with an index item
- Improved the detection of renamed items
- Enhanced logging to provide more context about why items are or aren't matched

These changes make the comparer more accurate in situations where:
- Content items have been renamed
- Multiple versions of the same item exist
- Complex content structures with many items at the same path

## Verification
The changes have been tested with real-world SenseNet indexes containing duplicate paths with different IDs, and now correctly show them as separate entries in the report.
