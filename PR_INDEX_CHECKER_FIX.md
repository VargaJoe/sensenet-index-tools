# PR: Fix False "Missing Item" Reports in Index Checker

## Description

This PR fixes a fundamental issue in the SubtreeIndexChecker where content items were incorrectly reported as missing from the index. The critical problem was that the `CheckItemInIndex` method was looking for incorrect field names in the Lucene index - using "NodeId" and "VersionId" instead of the correct "Id" and "Version_" fields that SenseNet actually uses.

## Changes Made

- **Corrected field names**: Fixed the field names used in all search strategies to match SenseNet's actual index structure
- **Fixed document validation**: Now we properly retrieve and validate documents from the index
- **Added thorough error handling**: Prevent exceptions from causing false negatives
- **Implemented direct scan fallback**: Added a last-resort scan for small indexes
- **Enhanced diagnostics**: Added detailed logging to help troubleshoot index issues
- **Fixed path-based search**: Properly handling lowercase paths and validating results

## Testing Done

- Tested against known SenseNet repositories
- Verified that items previously reported as missing are now correctly identified
- Added robust error handling to ensure consistent results

## Documentation

- Added `INDEX_CHECKER_FIX.md` explaining the issue and solution in detail
- Updated code comments to explain the search strategy

## Impact

This fix significantly improves the accuracy of the `check-subtree` command, eliminating false reports of missing items in the index. The change is backward compatible and requires no changes to how the tool is used.
